SpringBoot Registration Project

Setup a mail server:
https://github.com/maildev/maildev

You will also need a PostgreSQL database. You can configure this in the application.yml file.

Register a user using a tool like postman, and confirm the token on the email that is sent to the maildev server.

Access the login page at localhost:8080

If not authenticated, you will always be directed to the login page when accessing port 8080.
